# ICP Simple Site Frontend Boilerplate

This template gives you everything you need to build a full-stack Web3 application on the [Internet Computer](https://internetcomputer.org/).
It includes a frontend built with Vite and React, and a backend written in JS/TS (Azle).

## ðŸš€ Develop

When the editor opened, run the following commands to start a local ICP node and deploy the canister smart contract:

```bash
dfx start --clean # Start a local ICP node
# In a new terminal window:
dfx deploy # Deploy smart contract locally
```

To redeploy the smart contract, run `dfx deploy` again.

When ready, run `dfx deploy --playground` to deploy your application to the ICP playground.

## ðŸ’¡ Tips and Tricks

- If you get an error "Error: An error happened during communication with the replica: ... Connection refused", run `dfx start --clean` to start dfx.
